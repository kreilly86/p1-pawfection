# PAWFECTION
<hr>

Pawfection is a dog sitting service based in Galway, Ireland. The company was started after the founders realised there was a growing need for  an alternative to dog kennels for owners needing a place for their dog to stay while they go on holiday. 


Pawfection is aimed at dog owners in the Galway area, who may feel unsure and stressed about what to do with their dog when they go on holiday, or if they have an unforseen event that pops up and they need to find someone to sit their dog last minute. The services are highlighted clearly, with two options: our staff sitting the dog at the owners' home, or our staff sitting the dog in their home.

#### LOGO
<hr>
<br>
I made the logo using Canva with this [Logo Template](https://www.canva.com/templates/EAEmw6OtL8Q-pet-shelter-logo/) . I chose colors that would be warm, and contrast well agaist each other. The logo is also a clickable link to bring the user back to the homepage.

#### NAVIGATION BAR
<hr>
<br>
The navigation bar is displayed clearly at the top and center of each page. It is the same throughout the site and takes the user between the Home page, the About Us page, Dog sitting page, Testimonials page, and Contact page.
<br>

The navigation bar has a bottom border style applied to show the user which page they are currently on, and a hover psuedo class which impliments a background color and border bottom style when the user hovers over each page link.

#### FLEX DISPLAY IMAGES WITH TEXT BOXES

<br>
The About Us, Dog Sitting, and Testimonials pages have a simple design layout with warm colors, and images that compliment the text to give the user a positive sense of the business and its' ethos.
<br>
<br>
 Class attributes are used so that the style is consistent throughout the site. There are 4 different class selectors:
<br>
<br>
- One for a blue colored text box.
<br>
- One for the accompanying image.
<br>
- One for a gold colored text box.
<br>

For ease of use the display: flex layout is used so that each of these pages can be efficiently targeted for responsiveness.

#### THE ABOUT US PAGE
<hr>
<br>
The About us page gives a short description of how the business was formed, i.e that it met a need in the market for alternatives to dog kennels. For potential customers this information is vital so they are aware of the type of service provided.
<br>
<br>

#### DOG SITTING PAGE
<hr>
<br>
The Dog Sitting page utilizes the simple image and text box display to seperate the two types of dog sitting service the business provides:
<br>
<br>
- Dog sitting in the owners' own home.
<br>
- Dog sitting in one of the Pawfections staffs' homes.
<br>
<br>
At the bottom of the Dog Sitting page there is a gold colored horizontal rule to divide the main content from an additional feature. This feature is an internal link button that takes the user to the contact page. This makes it quick for the user to submit a dog sitting request once they have just read about the services provided
