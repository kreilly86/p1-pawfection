<h1> PAWFECTION </h1>
<hr>
<p>
Pawfection is a dog sitting service based in Galway, Ireland. The company was started after the founders realised there was a growing need for  an alternative to dog kennels for owners needing a place for their dog to stay while they go on holiday. 
</p>

<p>
Pawfection is aimed at dog owners in the Galway area, who may feel unsure and stressed about what to do with their dog when they go on holiday, or if they have an unforseen event that pops up and they need to find someone to sit their dog last minute. The services are highlighted clearly, with two options: our staff sitting the dog at the owners' home, or our staff sitting the dog in their home.
