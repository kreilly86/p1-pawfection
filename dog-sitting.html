            We understand some dog owners would
            much prefer their dog be able to stay in
            their own environment, where they feel
            safe and able to thrive.  We are happy to 
            provide a dog sitting service in your own 
            home where one of our staff will stay at
            your house for the duration of your time 
            away. We will meet you for a pre-assessment,
            where you will have the time and space to 
            communicate all the necessary information
            about your dog's routine, likes, dislikes and
            also share any important details of staying in
            your home. We will provide daily updates by
            text, sending photos and any other information
            you'd like to know.  We want you to feel at ease
            during your time away, and know that our highly
            trained and dedicated staff will take the best care
            of your beloved furry friend.

        <p>
        We also have dedicated staff who have
        made their homes available to host your dogs.
        We will meet you for a pre-assessment where 
        you can talk to the staff member, and if you
        want to we can facilitate this at their home
        wherever possible to make sure you feel comfortable
        having your dog stay away from their normal 
        surroundings. You will also have a chance
        to tell us anything we may need to know about your
        dog, their routine, likes and dislikes. We will let you 
        know if the staff member has their own dog,
        and make sure this won't be any issue. We find
        that the dogs do have an enriching time playing together,
         but also know for some dogs this
        isn't suitable, so we will try to find the best
        option for you. Daily updates and photos will 
        be sent by text.
