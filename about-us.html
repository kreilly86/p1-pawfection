    <div id="about-us">
        <p>
            Pawfection was founded in 2015 
            in Galway, Ireland. We noticed
            a growing number of people were
            not happy leaving their dog in
            kennels while they went away. 
            We decided to open our doors
            as an alternative solution to
            dog care for individuals and 
            families who needed a dog sitter.
            Showing the dogs in our care all 
            the needed 'affection' while they are
            away from their owners is our mantra.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We are a small team of dedicated staff,
            passionate about the care and well being
            of all the dogs we have the pleasure of
            sitting.

        We believe that each dog is individual,
        with a unique personality. Some dogs
        thrive on new adventures, while others
        need the stability of their own environment,
        and routines to keep them happy and
        healthy.

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        We endeavour to facilitate a stress free stay with your dog,
        whether in your own home or one of ours. our aim is to 
        give your dog the best experience, while you relax and
        enjoy your time away.
