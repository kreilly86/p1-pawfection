                <p>"We are so happy we found Pawfection. We
                    had a last minute family emergency, and knew
                    our dog Jack would not feel comfortable
                    going to a strange home while we were away.
                    The Pawfection staff took excellent care
                    of our little guy. The communication was
                    excellent, with daily photo updates. It has
                    taken us time to make Jack feel safe after
                    we rescued him, but he had no problem
                    bonding with the Pawfection staff member.
                    Would highly recommended this service
                    for anyone who is nervous to leave their
                    dog when they are heading away."

                    We went on holiday in the summer and they
                    were able to take Belle for a week in
                    one of their staff's homes. They made sure
                    to organise a meet up before we set off and
                    everything about the process put us at ease.
                    Belle had a blast while we were away, she was
                    able to get out for lots of walks and did
                    some socialising with some other dogs in
                    Pawfection's care. I think she had as good
                    a holiday as we did!"
